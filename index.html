                <p> My passion for computer science started the summer before sophomore year. I had stumbled upon CS professor David Malan's lectures on YouTube and became fascinated with the subject. It was then I completed my first coding project using Scratch, a block-based programming software. I created a game centered around a teenage girl, Ruby, who starts her first day at a new school. The code is very basic, but not bad for my first time!<br>

                <p> Fast forward one year later, I joined <z><a href="https://girlswhocode.com/" target="_blank"><u>Girls Who Code</u></a></z>, an organization that aims to support and increase the number of women in computer science. In July, I participated in the Summer Immersion Program, which culminated in me coding a final project using JavaScript. This collection-style game was much more advanced than my previous one, and focused on restoring life to a post-apocalyptic world. Players needed to collect seeds and water buckets without clicking on zombies.<br>

                <p> Most recently, I submitted a website I developed to the 2025 National STEM Festival. Using HTML and CSS, as well as research I did regarding adolescent attitudes, I created a digital information hub called "NY, Let's Talk About Climate Change" to raise awareness about the escalating threat of global warming. The platform consolidates important resources and climate-related discoveries in New York and across the U.S., making it easier for adolescents to inform themselves.<br>
